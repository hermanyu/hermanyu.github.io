                        <p>
                            Professional data sciencist working in marketing effectiveness analytics
                            with an educational background in mathematics. My
                            passion projects are in recommender systems including 
                            content-based recommendation using image recognition.
                            Currently building a fullstack web application
                            to deploy interactive recommender models.

                        <p>
                            Professionally, I build Media Mix Models (MMMs) to attribute 
                            sales to marketing spend. This allows our clients to accurately measure ROI in their
                            marketing investments and optimize marketing strategies. MMMs use econometric modeling
                            and statistical inference to circumvent the issues of multi-touch tracking (or lack-thereof).
                            I explain MMMs in more detail here.

                            Recommender systems are my primary field of interst, which can be viewed 
                            as "dual" to the concept of marketing. Where as image generation and large-language models,
                            attempt to solve very awe-inspiring problems, recommender systems attempt solve very 
                            relatable ones. How often have you been stuck on the question 
                            "what should we do for dinner?" Recommender systems present a "blue collar" side of 
                            machine learning, yet the engineering challenges are nuanced and complex.
