                                At its core, data science is just a collection of tools used to obtain information from data.
                                This blog post will discuss the concept of a data generation process (DGP) and how to generate our 
                                own synthetic data sets. The benefits of this discussion are two-fold: 1) it establishes a concrete 
                                framework to think about statistics and data science and 2) it provides us with the tools necessary to
                                create toy data sets (on which we can practice our fancy data science techniques).

                                Statistics is about using observed data to make inferences on the data generation process. 
                                The main challenge is that infinitely many data generation processes can give rise to the same data set.
                                In order to make the problem more tractable, one approach is to limit the range of possibilities by 
                                assuming the DGP has some specific parametric form.

                                Sometimes, we don't need to model the entire DGP, 
                                but just need a very specific quantity that is derived from samples of the DGP (e.g. confidence intervals and p-values).
                                Since our observed data is itself a sample of the DGP, it is sometimes possible to get estimates of our desired quantity 
                                without assuming any specific parameteric form for the DGP.

                                Often times, we will have very specific domain knowledge which places certain restrictions on what 
                                the DGP can and cannot be. Bayesian models allow us to specify a prior distributions to encapsulate
                                our understanding of what we consider "reasonable" beliefs about our DGPs.

                                Linear are parametric regression models from statistics which can 
                                be used to generate predictions for a quantity of interest. The main advantage of linear 
                                models is their interpretability and easiness to compute, but they present 2 main drawbacks. 
                                Drawback 1: they do not a priori capture non-linear behavior. Drawback 2: they do not a priori capture 
                                interactions between predictor variables. Because of these drawbacks, the user will typically have to 
                                manually engineer new features by creating non-linear terms and interaction terms. Drawback 1 can be 
                                decently resolved by generalizing to Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), but there is no getting around Drawback 2.

                                Logistic regression is really a linear regression applied to a transformed binary outcome variable. 
                                Logistic regression is mostly used for classification tasks, which presents interesting challenges 
                                when it comes to evaluating model performance.

                                Naive Bayes is a classification technique which uses conditional group means to 
                                determine group membership of each individual data points. If a data point X has features that 
                                are very abnormal for group A, it stands to reason that X is not likely to be a part of group A. 
                                Naive Bayes thus attempts to quantify how "abnormal" it is a data point to be a member of each group. 
                                This "abnormal"-ness is computed using Bayes theorem and by making a "naive" assumption that 
                                the input features are all independent from each other (hence the name: Naive Bayes).
